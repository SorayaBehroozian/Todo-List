 - `<Press 3, To edit a task>`
 - `<Press 4, To save and quit>`


##Task List

A printed message informs the user that she/he has the
choice to sort tasks by title or by due date
as well as returning to the main menu by pressing 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

###Add a task
User will be asked to enter the details of a task. A printed message
will guide the user. For example the appropriate date type will be
printed before the user enters their task due date:

`Please enter the due date for the task in format dd/mm/yyyy:>'
`

The only options for task status are _Done_ and _Undone_ and other
inputs cannot be accepted.

###Edit a task
A printed message informs the user that she/he has the
choice to update, remove or mark a task as done as well as returning
to the main menu.
